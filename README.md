# jQuery-Swift

This repo contains the
[jQuery](https://jquery.com)
packaged up as Swift Package Manager project.

Since the Swift Package Manager cannot yet deal with resource files,
this is a more convenient way to directly embed common resources
within your application.
It is pretty big though :-)
